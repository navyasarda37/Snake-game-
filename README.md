Snake Game HTML Implementation:This HTML document provides a straightforward implementation of the classic Snake game using HTML5 canvas and JavaScript. The key features of the code include:HTML Structure:The document structure includes a canvas element with the id "snakeCanvas" to facilitate game rendering.CSS Styling:CSS styles are applied to center the canvas on the page and provide a border for visual clarity.JavaScript Logic:Variables are initialized for the canvas context (ctx), box size, snake array, and initial direction.Functions:draw():Clears the canvas and redraws the snake, distinguishing the head with a different color.move():Updates the snake's position based on the current direction, creating a basic movement mechanism.Event Handling:Arrow keys control the snake's direction: Up, Down, Left, and Right.An event listener (changeDirection) adjusts the direction based on arrow key presses.Game Loop:The gameLoop function is established to repeatedly call draw and move at a set interval, creating continuous animation.Execution:The game loop is initiated using setInterval, ensuring continuous updates to the canvas and simulating the snake's movement.This code serves as a foundation for a simple Snake game and can be further extended with additional features like scoring, game over conditions, or enhanced styling to suit specific preferences.
